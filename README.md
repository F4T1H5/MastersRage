Unreal Engine 5 RPG Combat Game Project
=============================================

A game built with Unreal Engine 5 featuring a custom-developed Gameplay Ability System (GAS),
special attacks, blocks, and Niagara visual effects.

Thanks to Vince Petrelli and his course:

I learned a lot about the GAS system and developed my C++ skills.
